   - Create temporal elevation for scholar activity

3. **Export & Sharing**
   - Add map export functionality
   - Create shareable map views
   - Generate location-based reports

## ðŸ“Š Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components:
```
/app/map/page.tsx                    # Main map page
/components/map/
  â”œâ”€â”€ interactive-map.tsx            # Core map component
  â”œâ”€â”€ map-filters.tsx               # Filtering controls
  â”œâ”€â”€ map-legend.tsx                # Visual legend
  â””â”€â”€ map-overlays.tsx              # [Future] Historical overlays
```

### Data Flow:
1. **Supabase Query**: Fetch scholars with location data
2. **Data Processing**: Aggregate by coordinates, calculate statistics
3. **Marker Generation**: Create custom markers with scholar counts
4. **Interactive Features**: Handle clicks, popups, and navigation

### Key Technologies:
- **React Leaflet**: Interactive mapping library
- **Leaflet**: Core mapping engine
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive styling
- **Supabase**: Real-time data fetching

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy:
- **Marker Size**: Indicates scholar count (larger = more scholars)
- **Color Coding**: Represents primary time periods
- **Clustering**: Groups nearby locations for clarity
- **Information Density**: Balanced detail levels based on zoom

### User Experience:
- **Progressive Discovery**: Information revealed through interaction
- **Contextual Actions**: Relevant links and navigation options
- **Performance**: Smooth interactions with large datasets
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### Auto-Linking System:
